12. Now under Git Repositories tab->your local repository-> Branches->Local-> the local branch as "master" should be there.

13. Right click on the local->master branch and select "merge". On the merge window, make sure your local branch(step 12) is in local folder and remote branch (step 8) in Remote Tracking folder->Click on "Merge"->"Merged" txt should appear->Click ok.
